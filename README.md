# Dribbble Shot

A skeleton HTML &amp; CSS project used to create Dribbble shots

## Why does this exist?

I found myself designing and mocking-up layouts directly inside HTML/CSS more and more frequently over the years. Because of this, any work I decided to share on Dribbble became slightly more difficult since I rarely used specific design software like Sketch, Figma, etc.

And so, Dribbble Shots was born!

## Usage

Simply create your mockups with regular HTML/CSS inside the `.canvas` classname element. If you wish to create your shot @2x scale, just add the additional `.x2` class alongside `.canvas` before starting your project.

## Export

To keep things straightforward, use the default screenshot feature built into Firefox. You can target the specific `.canvas` element directly.

Not using Firefox? <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/">You really should be if you value privacy and a more open web.</a>

Enjoy!
